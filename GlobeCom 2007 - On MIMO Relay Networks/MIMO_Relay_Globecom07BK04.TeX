We investigate the effects of finite-rate feedback and imperfect
channel estimation on the end-to-end throughput of MIMO
beamforming relay network in this paper. We start from
multi-antenna beamforming transmission with uniform random
codebook and formulate the SNR loss due to channel estimation and
quantization. We then extend our analysis to MIMO relay network
with multiple relay nodes and discuss how the end-to-end capacity
is scaled by MIMO pilot channel size, codebook size and the number
of relay stations. Computer simulations are also provided to
support our results.

\section{Introduction}
Multi-antenna systems have received much attention for the past
decade or so, due to their promise of higher spectrum efficiency
with no transmit power increase. Combining wireless relay with
multi-antenna transceiver is essential not only to provide
comprehensive coverage but also to help relieve co-channel
interference in existing wireless systems. For multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, it is well-known that their
performance and complexity can be improved by making channel state
information (CSI) available at the transmitter. This is usually
achieved through a special reverselink CSI feedback channel from
receiver. For example, there is R-CQI channel for the 4G networks
UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband). In practice, the CSI received by the
transmitter is imperfect and suffers from various impairments and
limitations, which include round-trip delay, channel estimation
errors, limited codebook, etc. Therefore the actual link
throughput is usually degraded. This kind of loss may be more
serious if the end-to-end capacity is considered for a multi-hop
MIMO relay network.

Multi-antenna systems with quantized feedback have intensively
been investigated since 1990s~\cite{Gerlach94}. MIMO channel
quantization as well as codebook design in general is a Voronoi
decomposition problem, which is NP-hard. The Voronoi region for a
uniformly random codebook is known to be upper-bounded by the
disk-covering problem solution and lower-bounded by the
sphere-packing problem solution. Both of these two problems are
still open too. Optimal quantization and feedback for
multi-antenna system is studied in~\cite{Lau04}. MISO/MIMO
beamforming systems have intensively been investigated with
perfect CQI Lloyd vector quantization (VQ)~\cite{Narula98},
different channel model~\cite{Mukka03} and performance
metrics~\cite{PXia04,Roh04}. It is linked to Grassmannian line
packing problem by~\cite{Love02}. However, most of existing work
is done without considering the actual pilot design and channel
estimation, which are among the most important components of
actual multi-antenna systems. In reality, MIMO CSI is estimated
using forward-link common pilot channels sent by transmitter. An
overview of pilot-assisted transmission (PAT) as well as pilot
placement and channel estimation can be found in~\cite{Tong04}. In
most existing MIMO systems, pilot channels are designed to be
orthogonal to other channels and sent periodically by transmitter.
Nonorthogonal pilot design like superimposed pilots has recently
received much attention for channel estimation
too~\cite{Coldrey06}. Optimal pilot placement was investigated
in~\cite{Dong02}. In practical system design, it is important to
understand how MIMO pilot and codebook design affect system
throughput, what is the achievable balance between them, etc. And
these problems become more critical when a multi-hop MIMO relay
network with beamforming is considered.

It is known that there is no simple solution to optimal MIMO
channel quantization and codebook design. In this paper, a
heuristic Voronoi boundary, Hamming boundary, is formulated using
Hamming bound. This heuristic boundary can be taken as a tradeoff
between disk-covering circle and sphere-packing boundary and
asymptotically they will converged together when the codebook size
is increasing. With this Hamming boundary for channel
quantization, the SINR degradation of MIMO beamforming is then
discussed. For channel estimation, both time-multiplexed pilots
(TMP) and SIP are considered and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is
presented for each of them. It is shown that channel estimation
error affects the accuracy of both channel quantization and
transmit power allocation except in some special cases. After
these, we extend our conclusions to MIMO relay network with
beamforming and discuss the scalability of the MIMO beamforming
with codebook size, pilot size, relay network size, etc.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the
MIMO beamforming system model is established and problem is
formulated. In Section III/IV, the effects of channel quantization
and estimation error is discussed. Asymptotic analysis for MIMO
relay network are presented in Section V. Section VI contains
concluding remarks.
\section{MIMO Link Model And Problem Description\label{MIMO_system_model}}
Consider a MIMO link consisting of a transmitter with $M$ transmit
antennas, a receiver with $N$ receive antenna and a MIMO channel
represented by the $N\times M$ matrix $\bH=\left[\bh_{1}\ \bh_{2}\
\ldots\ \bh_{M}\right]$ with $\bh_{m}=\left[h_{1,m}\ h_{2,m}\
\ldots\ h_{N,m}\right]^{\rm T}$ . The $N\times 1$ received signal
$\by$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\by&=&\left[y_{1}\ y_{2}\ \ldots\ y_{N}\right]^{\rm T}& = &
\bH\bW\bx+\bn
\end{array}\label{Direct_MIMO}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bx=\left[x_{1}\ x_{2}\ \ldots\ x_{M}\right]^{\rm
T}$ is the $M\times 1$ signal vector transmitted by the source
with $\bR_{\bx}=\mbox{E}\left\{\bx\bx^{\rm
H}\right\}=\frac{P}{M}\bI_{M}$, $P$ is the total transmit power,
$\bW=\left[\bw_{1}\ \bw_{2}\ \ldots\ \bw_{M}\right]$ is a $M\times
M$ MIMO beamforming precoding matrix with
$\left\|\bw_{m}\right\|_2=1$, $\bn\sim{\bcC\bcN}(0,
\sigma^2\bI_{N})$ is a complex circular white Gaussian vector,
$\left[\ast\right]^{\rm T}$ and $\left[\ast\right]^{\rm H}$
denotes the transport operation and Hermitian conjugate operation,
respectively. It is known that the achievable MIMO channel
throughput or efficiency is~\footnote{Without loss of the
generality, the channel bandwidth is normalized to be $1$ in this
paper. }
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.2in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\eta &=& \log\left|\bI_{N}+\frac{P}{M}\bH\bW\bW^{\rm H}\bH^{\rm
H}\right|\\
& =& \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\log\left(1+\frac{\rho_{i}}{M}\right)
\end{array}\label{spectral_eff}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rho_{i}$ denotes the received signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the $k$th beam, which is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\rho_{i}&=&\frac{\mbox{var}\left\{\bH\bw_{i}x_{i}\right\}}{\sigma^2}&=&\frac{\lambda_{i}P_{i}}{\sigma^2}
\end{array}\label{SNR_i}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $\lambda_{i}$ denoting the antenna gain of the
$i$th beam and also the $i$th eigenvalue of the MIMO channel
autocorrelation matrix $\bR_{\bH}$ defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\bR_{\bH}=\bH\bH^{\rm H}=\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\bh_{m}\bh_{m}^{\rm
H}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{M}\lambda_{m}\bv_{i}\bv_{i}^{\rm H}
\end{array},\label{R_h}
\end{equation}
\noindent $\bv_{i}$ denotes the $i$th eigenvector, the operator
$\left|\ast\right|$ denotes the determinant of matrix $\ast$, and
$\mbox{var}\left\{\ast\right\}$ denotes the variance of random
variable $\ast$. Equation (\ref{spectral_eff}) and (\ref{SNR_i})
are the results from the assumption of perfect CSI available at
transmitter. This is the case in practical applications.

In reality, the receiver estimates channel $\bH$ or $\bR_{\bH}$
with the pilots sent by transmitter. Accuracy of the channel
estimator depends on the pilot design and placement. There are two
popular pilot patterns, TMP and SIP, received much attention for
MIMO channel estimation, which are shown in
Fig.~\ref{pilot_pattern}. TMP is a typical example of orthogonal
pilot design where pilot symbols and data symbols are separated in
both time and frequency domain, which make them orthogonal to each
other. In orthogonal pilot design, the channel estimation and data
demodulation can be done separately which may lead to simple
receiver design~\cite{Dong02}. However, SIP does the opposite. In
SIP design, where pilot and data symbols share the same time
period and frequency band and nonorthogonal to each other. In this
case, joint channel estimation/demodulation and demodulation with
pilot interference cancellation are among the most popular
receiver designs~\cite{Coldrey06}. After channel estimation,
receiver will choose a beamforming vector from a shared MIMO
precoding codebook. This is called channel quantization. And the
receiver then feeds back the chosen precoding index(es) to the
transmitter for the next transmission instead of the estimated
channel response with the assumption that the channels is not
changing fast. A MIMO codebook $\bcW$ of the size $2^B$ consisting
of $M$-dimensional normalized vectors $\left\{\bw_{1}, ...,
\bw_{2^{B}}\right\}$ is considered here. It usually takes the
receiver to feedback $B$ bits for each beam stream. A codebook is
usually designed to quantize channel responses with certain
distortion measures~\cite{Narula98}. This procedure is related to
Grassmannian line packing and spherical packing on unit sphere
$\bcS_{n}\left(1\right)$~\cite{conway96packing}, where
$\bcS_{n}(R)=\left\{\bv:\ \left\|\bv\right\|=R\right\}$ denotes
$(n-1)$-sphere of radius $R$.
\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=3in, angle=0]{Pilot_Patterns.eps}
\caption{Pilot patterns for channel
estimation.}\label{pilot_pattern} }
\end{figure}
When a codeword $\bw_k$ is chosen to precode transmit signals for
$i$th beam $\bv_{i}$ at the transmitter side, usually some
degradation will happen on the signal received by receiver because
of imperfect channel estimation and finite-rate feedback. This
degradation on received signals can be expressed by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\delta_{i} & = & \min\limits_{\bw\in\bcW}\left\|\bH\bv_{i}-\bH\bw\right\|\\
&=&\lambda_{i}\left(1-\bv_{i}^{\rm
H}\bw_k\right)-\sum\limits_{j\neq i}\lambda_{j}\bv_{j}^{\rm
H}\bw_{k}
\end{array}\label{delta_i}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bv_{i}$ is the ideal precoding vector for $i$th
eigen-mode of $\bH$. It is known that $\delta_{i}$ is one of the
major factors limiting closed-loop MIMO beamforming throughput,
which depends on $\bv_{i}$, $\bw_{k}$ and $\lambda_{i}$, etc.
There are two components in (\ref{delta_i}). The first term is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\Delta&=&\lambda_{i}\left(1-\bv_{i}^{\rm
H}\bw_k\right)&=&\left(1-\alpha_{i}\right)\lambda_{i}
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent which denotes the degradation of antenna gain, where
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\alpha_{i}&=&\bv_{i}^{\rm H}\bw_k
\end{array}.\label{alpha}
\end{equation}
\noindent The second term is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
I_{} & = & \sum\limits_{j\neq i}\lambda_{j}\bv_{j}^{\rm
H}\bw_{k}&=&\sum\limits_{j\neq i}\alpha_{j}\bw_{k}
\end{array}\label{IBI}
\end{equation}
\noindent denoting inter-beam interference (IBI) due to the
correlation between $\bw_{k}$ and other eigen-modes $\bv_{j}$,
$j\neq i$. The average received signal-to-noise/interference ratio
(SINR) for the $i$th eigen-mode with the codeword $\bw_{i}$ can be
written by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar\rho_{i}&=&\mbox{E}_{\bv_{i}\in{\cal
V}_{k}}\left\{\frac{\lambda_{i}\left(\bv_{i}^{\rm
H}\bw_{k}\right)^2P_{i}}{n_{0}^2+ \lambda_{i}\sum\limits_{l\neq
i}^{K}\left(\bv_{i}^{\rm H}\bw_{l}\right)^{2}P_{l}}\right\}\\
&=&\mbox{E}_{\bv_{i}\in{\cal
V}_{k}}\left\{\frac{\alpha_{i}^{2}\rho_{i}}{1+
\lambda_{i}\sum\limits_{l\neq
i}^{K}\frac{\alpha_{l}^{2}}{\lambda_{l}}\rho_{l}}\right\}\ ,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $K\leq\mbox{min}\left\{M,\ N\right\}$ denotes the
number of beams in use.

The achievable throughput of MIMO beamforming depends on not only
the chosen precoding vectors $\bW$ but also the power distribution
$P_{k}$, $k=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ K$. There are many power allocation
strategies for assigning how much power to each beam with
different performance metrics. When maximizing MIMO throughput is
the major concern, the so-called water-filling strategy can be
used so that $P_{k}$ satisfies
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
P_{k}=\left(\mu-\frac{\sigma_{n}^2}{\lambda_{k}}\right)^{+}=
\begin{cases}
\mu-\frac{\sigma_{n}^2}{\lambda_{k}} & \mu-\frac{\sigma_{n}^2}{\lambda_{k}} >0 \\
0 & \mu-\frac{\sigma_{n}^2}{\lambda_{k}} < 0
\end{cases}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
with $\mu$ chosen so that the total power constraint is satisfied
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}P_{k}&=&P
\end{array}.\label{power_constraint}
\end{equation}
\noindent If the delay-limited power allocation strategy is used,
then
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
P_{k}&=&\frac{\mu}{\lambda_{k}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
with $\mu$ chosen to satisfy (\ref{power_constraint}). This is
also called channel inversion strategy. Another simple but popular
strategy for allocating transmit power is to assign each beam the
average power so that
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
P_{k}&=&\frac{P}{K}
\end{array}.\label{P_aver}
\end{equation}
\noindent In the following sections, we will discuss how the
channel quantization error and imperfect channel estimation affect
the received SINR and channel capacity, individually.
\section{Hamming Bound on Channel Quantization}
\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=3.20in, angle=0]{Voronoi_Bounds.eps}
\caption{Voronoi cell and various bounds}\label{Voronoi_bound} }
\end{figure}
It is known that the performance of channel quantization depends
on the Voronoi cell for each codeword. If the Voronoi
decomposition for the codebook is known, the statistic of the
correlation ratio $\alpha_i$, $i=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ K$ defined in
(\ref{alpha}) can be calculated. The same to the SINR $\rho_{i}$.
However, the closed-form expression of a general Voronoi cell
boundary, which is a polytope, is an open-problem even for regular
Voronoi tessellation. This makes it difficult in obtaining some
insight of the average SINR as well as achievable throughput for
each eigen-mode beamforming. There are some other problems related
to the Voronoi decomposition problem. Among them, two problems are
well-known. The first problem is called disk-covering problem in
which, given a unit disk, the problem is to find the smallest
radius for $n$ equal disks to completely cover the unit disk. The
other one is sphere-packing problem which concern arrangements of
non-overlapping identical spheres to fill a space. The
relationship between Voronoi cell and the solutions to
disk-covering problem and sphere-packing problem is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{Voronoi_bound}. Basically sphere-packing solution gives
a lower-bound approximation of Voronoi cell and disk-covering
solution present a upper-bound approximation of it. However, these
two problems are still open in general. Instead of finding the
exact boundary for the Voronoi cell $\bcV_{i}$, we suggest another
heuristic approach, in which we use a sphere cap to approximate
the actual polytope boundary by approaching Hamming bound. This is
similar to sphere packing. However, all spheres are
non-overlappedly placed with sphere-packing. With our approach,
the interior of each sphere cap has the same area as the Voronoi
cell and they are overlapped with each other in space. The border
of this sphere cap is termed Hamming boundary. The relationship
between Hamming boundary and Voronoi cell is also shown in
Fig.~\ref{Voronoi_bound}.

With the concept of Hamming bound, the sum of sphere-cap areas is
the same as the area of the codebook sphere, which is also same to
the sum of Voronoi-cell areas. For an uniform random codebook of
size $2^{B}$ in $M$-dimensional Euclid space, the area of a
Voronoi cell is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
A\left(\bcV_{k}\right)&=&
\frac{2{\pi}^{M}}{2^{B}\Gamma\left(M\right)}
\end{array}\label{V_area}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\Gamma\left(\ast\right)$ denotes the gamma
function. On the other hand, the area of $(m-1)$-complex sphere
cap $\bcC_{m}^{\rm c}\left(\psi,\ R\right)$ with contact angle
$\psi$ and radius $R$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
A\left(\bcC_{m}^{\rm c}\left(\psi,\
R\right)\right)&=&\Phi_{m}\left(\psi\right)S_{2m}\left(R\right)
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\Phi_{m}\left(\psi\right)$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\Phi_{m}\left(\psi\right)&=&1-\cos^{(2m-2)}\left(\psi\right)
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent The examples of sphere and sphere-cap are shown in
Fig.~\ref{Sphere_Cap}. It can be verified that on a area of a
$(m-1)$-complex sphere $S_{m}^{c}\left(R\right)$ with the radius
$R$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
A\left(S_{m}^{c}\left(R\right)\right)&=&A\left(\bcC_{m}^{\rm
c}\left(\pi,\ \bw\right)\right)
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=2.20in, angle=0]{Sphere_Cap.eps}
\caption{Sphere and sphere cap}\label{Sphere_Cap} }
\end{figure}
\noindent Now the boundary of a Voronoi cell can be approximated
by a hypershpere or a closed space curve decided in the following
proposition.
\begin{Prop}\label{approx_bound}(Hamming Boundary) The boundary of the uniform complex Voronoi cell $\bcV_{k}$ can be
approximated by a $(M-1)$-unit complex sphere or a closed complex
space curve.
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.05in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bB\left(\bcV_{k}\right)&\approx& \bcS_{M}^{\rm c}(1)\bigcap \bcL_{M}^{\rm c}(\bw_{k},\ \cos(\theta)) \\
&=&\left\{\bv:\ \left\|\bv\right\|=1,\ \angle\left(\bv,\
\bw_{k}\right)=\theta\right\}\ ,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where ${\bcS}_{M}^{\rm c}\left(R\right)$ denotes a
$M$-dimension complex ball in Euclid space with the radius $R$ and
$\bcL_{M}^{\rm c}\left(\bw_{k},\ \cos(\theta)\right)=\left\{\bv:\
\bv^{\rm H}\bw_{k}=\cos(\theta)\right\}$ denotes a complex space
curve and $\theta$ is
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.00in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\theta&=&\arccos\left(\alpha_{0}\right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent with
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.00in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\alpha_{0}&=&\left(\frac{2^B-1}{2^B}\right)^{\frac{1}{2M-2}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent denoting the maximum antenna gain loss ratio.
\end{Prop}

On the other hand, it is known that the probability density
function (PDF) $\mbox{pr}\left(\alpha\right)$ and the cumulated
density function (CDF) $\mbox{Pr}\left(\alpha\right)$ of $\alpha$
are
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{pr}\left(\alpha\right)&=&\mbox{Prob}\left\{x=\alpha\right\}\\
&=&\begin{cases}
0 & 0\leq \alpha < \alpha_{0} \\
\frac{\left(2M-2\right)\alpha\left(1-\alpha^2\right)^{M-2}}{\left(1-\alpha_{0}^{2}\right)^{M-1}}
& \alpha_{0}\leq\alpha\leq 1
\end{cases}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent and
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{Pr}\left(\alpha\right)&=&\mbox{Prob}\left\{x\leq\alpha\right\} \\
&=&
\begin{cases}
0 & 0 \leq\alpha < \alpha_{0} \\
1-\left(\frac{1-\alpha^2}{1-\alpha_{0}^2}\right)^{M-1} &
\alpha_{0}\leq\alpha\leq 1
\end{cases}\ .
\end{array}
\end{equation}

With the assumption of uniform random codebook and beam-power
distribution, the average received SINR $\bar\rho_{i}$ can be
lower-bounded by the following conclusion.
\begin{lemma} A heuristic bound of the mean of $\rho_{i}$
can be expressed by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar\rho_{i}&\gtrsim& \frac{\sigma_{\alpha}^{2}\rho_{i}}{1+
\left(\frac{1-\sigma_{\alpha}}{M-1}\right)^{2}\sum\limits_{j\neq
i}\frac{\lambda_{i}}{\lambda_{j}}\rho_{j}}\ ,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where  $\sigma_{\alpha}$ denotes the standard deviation
of $\alpha$ and $\sigma_{\alpha}^2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sigma_{\alpha}^2&=&\mbox{E}\left\{\alpha_{i}^2\right\}\\
&=&\int\limits_{1}^{\alpha_{0}}\frac{\left(2M-2\right)\alpha^3\left(1-\alpha^2\right)^{M-2}}{\left(1-\alpha_{0}^{2}\right)^{M-1}}d\alpha\\
&=&\frac{1}{M}+\frac{M-1}{M}\alpha_{0}^2\ .
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\section{Cramer-Rao Bound on Channel Estimation}
The MIMO channel model presented in Section
\ref{MIMO_system_model} is symbol-based without considering
inter-symbol interference (ISI). In general, the channel
estimation model for frequency-selective block fading channel is
different to (\ref{Direct_MIMO}). It shall consider not only the
time-domain spreading of channel impulse response but also the
pilot placement. Consider $M$-input and $N$-output channels. The
channels are assumed to be frequency-selective block fading, which
means the random channels taps remain constant for some data
packets and change to independent values for the next. The
baseband received signal can be written as:
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.20in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\by(t)&=&\left[\begin{matrix}y_{1}(t)&y_{2}(t)&\cdots&y_{N}(t)\end{matrix}\right]^{\rm T}\\
&=&\left[\begin{matrix}\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}h_{m,1}(t)\otimes s_m(t)\\ \sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}h_{m,2}(t)\otimes s_m(t)\\ \vdots \\
\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}h_{m,N}(t)\otimes

&=&\left[\begin{matrix}\bh_{1}^{\rm T}(t)\otimes \bs(t)\\ \bh_{2}^{\rm T}(t)\otimes \bs(t)\\ \vdots \\
\bh_{N}^{\rm T}(t)\otimes \bs(t)\end{matrix}\right]+\bn\ ,
% &=&\bH(t)\otimes\bs(t)+\bn \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bh_{m}(l)=\left[h_{1,m}(l)\ h_{2,m}(l)\ \ldots\
h_{N,m}(l)\right]^{\rm T}$ for $1\leq l \leq L_{c}$ is the channel
impulse response vector from the $M$ transmit antennas to the
$n$th receive antenna and $L_{c}$ is the maximum channel order for
all $N$ subchannels. $s_m(t)$ denotes the transmitted symbol from
the $m$th antenna and $n$ represents the independent additive
Gaussian white noise. Due to the commutativity of convolution, the
stretched discrete received signal vector could as well be
expressed by the following expression
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.00in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\by&=&\bS\bh+\bn
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bh$ is the stretched channel vector defined by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.00in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bh&=&\mbox{vec}\left(\left[\mbox{vec}(\bH_{1})\
\mbox{vec}(\bH_{2})\ \ldots\ \mbox{vec}(\bH_{M})\right]\right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $\bH_{k}=\left[\bh_{k}(0)\ \bh_{k}(1)\ \ldots\
\bh_{k}(L_{c}-1)\right]$ and
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.00in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bS&=&\mbox{kron}\left(\left[\bS_{1}\ \bS_{2}\ \ldots\
\bS_{M}\right]^{\rm T},\ \bI\right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent with
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bS_{k}&=&\left[\begin{matrix}
s_{k}(L)&\cdots&s_{k}(L-L_{c})\\
s_{k}(L-1)&\cdots&s_{k}(L-L_{c}-1)\\
\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
s_{k}(1)&\cdots&s_{k}(1-L_{c})
\end{matrix}\right]
\end{array}.\label{S_k}
\end{equation}
After the channel response vector $\bh$ is estimated, we can
calculate the channel correlation matrix $\bR_{\bH}$ by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bR}_{\bH}&=&\frac{1}{L_{c}}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L_{c}}\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\bh_{m}\left(L_{c}+l\right)\bh_{m}^{\rm
H}\left(L_{c}+l\right)
\end{array}\label{R_h_actual}
\end{equation}
\noindent There are many ways to put pilot symbols and data
symbols together. Here we will focus on two most popular designs:
(i) {\em orthogonal design}, {time-multiplexed pilot pattern}, and
(ii) {\em non-orthogonal design}, {superimposed pilot pattern}.
\subsubsection{Time-Multiplexed Pilots and Data}
The concept of TMP design is to send $Q$ known pilot symbols
first, which is followed by $D$ data symbols. It is shown in
Fig.~\ref{pilot_pattern}(a). At this time, the transmitted symbol
$s_{k}(l)$ defined in (\ref{S_k}) becomes
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
s_{k}\left(l\right)&=&
\begin{cases}
s_{pk}(l) & 1 \leq l \leq Q \\
s_{dk}(l-Q) & Q+1\leq l\leq L
\end{cases}
\end{array},\label{TMP_k}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $s_{pk}(t)$, $1\leq t \leq Q$, denotes the pilot
symbols transmitted in power $\sigma_{p}^2$ and $s_{dk}(t)$,
$Q+1\leq t \leq L$, denotes the data symbols transmitted in power
$\sigma_{d}^2$. Since the pilot symbols are transmitted separately
from data symbols in time domain, the channel estimation and data
demodulation usually is done separately at the receiver.
\subsubsection{Superimposed Pilots and Data}
In SIP design, data symbols and pilot symbols are simultaneously
sent within one frame of $L$ symbols. This can be shown in
Fig.~\ref{pilot_pattern}(b). In this case, the transmitted symbol
$s_{k}(l)$ becomes
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
s_{k}\left(l\right)&=&\frac{\sigma_{p}}{P}s_{pk}\left(l\right)+\frac{\sigma_{d}}{P}s_{dk}\left(l\right)\
,\ 1\leq l\leq L\ ,
\end{array}\label{SIP_k}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $\sigma_{p}^2+\sigma_{d}^2=P$.

The lower bound to the mean-squared errors (MSE) of unbiased
channel estimates is given by CRLB, which is defined as the
inverse of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). If we denotes
$\bvartheta=\left[\bh^{\rm T}\ \bs_{d}^{\rm T}\right]^{\rm T}$,
the complex FIM is given by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{F}\left(\bvartheta\right)&=&\mbox{E}\left\{\left[\frac{\partial\ln\mbox{Pr}\left(\by|\vartheta\right)}{{\partial\vartheta}^{\ast}}\right]\left[\frac{\partial\ln\mbox{Pr}\left(\by|\vartheta\right)}{{\partial\vartheta}^{\ast}}\right]^{\rm H}\right\}\\
 &\hspace{-0.90in}=&\hspace{-0.50in}\sigma_{n}^{-2}\left[\begin{matrix}
\mbox{E}\left\{\bS^{\rm
H}\bS\right\}+\rho_{h}^2\bI&\bzero\\
\bzero&\mbox{E}\left\{\bcH^{\rm H}\bcH\right\}+\rho_{s_{d}}^2\bI
\end{matrix}\right]\ ,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
$\rho_{h}^{2}=\mbox{E}\left\{\left|\frac{\partial\ln\mbox{Pr}\left(h\right)}{{\partial
h}^{\ast}}\right|^2\right\}$ and
$\rho_{s_{d}}^{2}=\mbox{E}\left\{\left|\frac{\partial\ln\mbox{Pr}\left(s_{d}\right)}{{\partial
s_{d}}^{\ast}}\right|^2\right\}$. Here we combine two well-known
conclusions into the following lemma~\cite{Dong02,Coldrey06}.
\begin{lemma}(Cramer-Rao Lower Bound) For the time-multiplexed pilot and data design defined in
(\ref{TMP_k}), the CRLB of channel estimation is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\varepsilon_{h}^{\rm
TMP}&\geq&\left[\rho_{h}^2+Q\rho_{p}^2+\left(L-Q\right)\rho_{d}^2\right]^{-1}
\end{array}\label{CRLB_TMP}
\end{equation}
\noindent and, for the superimposed pilot and data design defined
in (\ref{SIP_k}), the CRLB of channel estimation is
\begin{equation}\
\begin{array}{rcl}
\varepsilon_{h}^{\rm
SIP}&\geq&\left[\rho_{h}^2+L\left(\rho_{p}^2+\rho_{d}^2\right)\right]^{-1}
\end{array}\label{CRLB_SIP}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\rho_{p}^2=\frac{\sigma_{p}^2}{\sigma_{n}^2}$
denotes the SNR of received pilot signals and
$\rho_{d}^2=\frac{\sigma_{d}^2}{\sigma_{n}^2}$ denotes the SNR of
received data signals.
\end{lemma}
Now if we look back at (\ref{R_h_actual}), with the assumption
that the channel is constant during estimation and independent
from one transmit antenna to another and an optimal channel
estimation is done by receiver, a heuristic view of the MIMO
channel correlation matrix can be written by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bR}_{\bH}&\approx&\bR_{\bH}+\frac{\varepsilon_{h}^2}{L_{c}}\bI_{M}
\end{array},\label{R_h_approx}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\varepsilon_{h}$ denotes the MSE of channel
estimates. With (\ref{R_h_approx}), it shows that the channel
estimation error at the receiver side will mostly affect the
accuracy of the eigenvalues estimated by the receiver and
therefore the execution of power allocation strategy, except the
average power allocation defined in (\ref{P_aver}). The MSE of
eigenvalue estimates is bounded by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\varepsilon_{\lambda}&\gtrsim&\frac{\varepsilon_{h}}{\sqrt{L_{c}}}
\end{array}.\label{eigenvalue_bound}
\end{equation}
There are two major effects of PAT on MIMO channel throughput.
This first one is pilots will take away channel resources from
data transmission.  If orthogonal pilot pattern is used, there are
will be linearly degradation on channel throughput so that
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.2in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\eta^{\rm OT}& =&\frac{L-Q}{L}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\log\left(1+\frac{\hat{\rho}_{i}}{M}\right)
\end{array},\label{spectral_eff_OT}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\hat{\rho}_{i}$ denotes the suboptimal power
allocation due to channel estimation error. If superimposed pilot
pattern is employed, the MIMO throughput will become
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.2in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\eta^{\rm
SI}&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}\log\left(1+\frac{\sigma_{d}^{2}}{P}\frac{\hat{\rho}_{i}}{M}\right)
\end{array}.\label{spectral_eff_SI}
\end{equation}
