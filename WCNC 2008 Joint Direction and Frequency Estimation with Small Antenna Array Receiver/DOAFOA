\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we examine several high-resolution subspace
algorithms for joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and
frequency-of-arrival (FOA) estimation using a small ESPRIT
receiver, the physical size of which can be smaller than the
number of incoming signals. We modify the classic ESPRIT algorithm
so that the direction and frequency of each incoming signal can be
jointly obtained from the eigenvalue and eigenvector pair of a
special signal parameter matrix. No additional searching procedure
or pairing scheme is required. Furthermore, with analysis of the
employed correlation matrices, both space-time processing and
total least squares (TLS) improvement schemes are given. In
addition to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB), first-order
approximations of the asymptotic mean squared error in the
estimates are also derived for all the proposed methods. Computer
simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
proposed schemes.

\section{Introduction}
The application of antenna arrays is expected to overcome the
problem of limited channel bandwidth, thereby fulfilling the
increased demands for a large number of mobiles on communication
channels and various mobile communications services~\cite{Rapp96}.
In wireless communication systems, one can also obtain better
channel estimates and improve system performance with array signal
processing technologies~\cite{Chen99}. In these applications,
high-resolution signal parameter estimation, e.g., DOA/FOA
estimation, within the output data of an array of sensors at
different points in space and/or time in a wave-field is
frequently studied. Roy et al. proposed a patented subspace
rotation approach, ESPRIT, for signal parameter
estimation~\cite{Paul85,Roy86}, which can be employed to find the
direction or frequency in a computationally efficient manner. It
is search-free and fairly robust without using array calibration
information, and has been found to be competitive with many other
algorithms, with its performance is close to the calibrated
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for many cases of practical interest.

Though generalization of many so-called high-resolution one
dimensional (1D) algorithms to two-dimensional (2D) cases are
relatively straightforward, the main difficulty associated with
these methods is that both computation and storage costs tend to
increase rapidly with the number of dimensions of the parameter
vector due to searching~\cite{Zolt96,Wong97,Bro98} and/or
non-trivial pairing procedures~\cite{Chen92,Veen92,Kedi96}. Since
those high-resolution 2D methods give a considerably higher
computational cost, many systems employ non-parametric techniques
in practice, e.g., beam-forming. Though these classical techniques
are less complicated, their performance is known to be
poor~\cite{Goda97}. Additionally, most modern high-resolution
techniques require that the size of the antenna array must be
greater than the number of tracked signal sources. This, in turn,
may further render the applicability of these techniques
unattractive~\cite{Wang98}.

In this paper, we propose joint direction and frequency estimation
algorithms for small ESPRIT array systems, which consist of
doublets and the size of which is less than the number of incoming
signals. These proposed algorithms are simple and direct with no
additional search or pairing procedure. Furthermore, thorough
analysis of the employed correlation matrices, a space-time
processing improvement scheme and a TLS estimation scheme are
proposed to improve the performance of the proposed algorithms. In
addition to the CRLB, the calculation of the first-order
approximation of estimation errors for all the proposed algorithms
are also presented. Finally, computer simulation results and
comparisons are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
proposed schemes.

\section{Space-Time Array Data Model}

Assume there are $K$ uncorrelated narrow-band radiating sources
which emit plane wave signals, $s_{k}(t)$, with different center
frequencies, $f_{k}$, from distinct directions, $\theta_{k}$,
$k=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $K$, corrupted by a additive Gaussian white
noise (AWGN) with variance, $\sigma^2$, at the array receiver. We
assume that the plane waves and additive noise are stationary
zero-mean processes and uncorrelated from sensor to sensor. The
complex form of the observed signal, $r_m(t)$, at the $m$th
antenna element of the array can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_m(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^Ka_m(f_k,\ \theta_k)s_k(t)e^{-j2\pi
f_kt}+n_m(t)
\end{array}\label{ScaleModel}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $a_m(f_k,\ \theta_k)$ is the complex response
(gain and phase) of antenna $m$ at frequency $f_k$ and direction
$\theta_k$, $s_k(t)$ is the narrow-band signal and the size of
array receiver is $M$. The observed array signal samples can be
further expressed in vector and matrix form as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br_T^{m}(t)&=&[r_m(t)\ r_m(t+T_s)\ \ldots\ r_m(t+(L-1)T_s)]^T\\
&=&\bA_T^{\ast}\bs(t)+\bn_T^{m}(t)\hspace{0.1in}
\end{array}
\label{VectorModelT}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\bcR(t)=[\br_T^1(t)\ \br_T^2(t)\ \ldots\ \br_T^M(t)]^T
=\bA_{S}\bS(t)\bA_{T}^{H}+\bN(t)
\end{array} \label{MatrixModel}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\br_T^m(t)$ is obtained by taking $L$ consecutive
samples at the $m{\mbox{th}}$ antenna. The $M\times L$ matrix
$\bcR(t)$ is the received signal matrix, which can be constructed
from the temporal signal vector $\br_T^{m}(t)$. The parameter
$T_s=1/f_s$ denotes the inverse of the sampling frequency, $f_s$,
$[\cdot]^\ast$ denotes the complex conjugate operation,
$[\cdot]^T$ denotes the transpose operation and $[\cdot]^H$
denotes the complex conjugate transpose operation. In
(\ref{MatrixModel}), the $M\times K$ matrix $\mathbf{A}_S$ is
labeled a {\em spatial steering matrix} and can be written as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bA_S & = & [\ba_S(f_1,\theta_1)\ \ba_S(f_2,\theta_2)\ \ldots\
\ba_S(f_K,\theta_K)]\hspace{0.1in}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent of which the $k{th}$ column, $\mathbf{a}_S(f_k,\
\theta_k)$, is the {\em spatial steering vector} for the
$k\mbox{th}$ arriving wave-front. Likewise, the $L\times K$ matrix
$\mathbf{A}_T$ is labeled a {\em temporal steering matrix} and is
written as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bA_T&=&[ \ba_T(f_1)\ \ba_T(f_2)\ \ldots\ \ba_T(f_K)]
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent of which the $k$th column

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\ba_T(f_k)=[1\hspace{0.1in}e^{j2\pi f_k/f_s}\hspace{0.1in}
e^{j4\pi f_k/f_s}\hspace{0.1in}\ldots\ e^{j2\pi (L-1)f_k/f_s}]^T
\end{array}\label{a_T}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the {\em temporal steering vector}. The parameters


\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bs(t)&=&[s_1(t),\ s_2(t),\ \ldots,\ s_K(t)]^T\  \\ \\
\bS(t)&=&\mbox{diag}\{s_1(t),\ s_2(t),\ \ldots,\ s_K(t)\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}


\noindent are the $K\times 1$ vector and $K\times K$ diagonal
matrix for the $K$ carrier signals, respectively. $\bn_T^{m}(t)$
and $\bN(t)$ are the corresponding $L\times 1$ noise vector and
$M\times L$ noise matrix, respectively.

\section{Joint DOA/FOA Estimation Using ESPRIT}

We assume that there is a simple uncalibrated ESPRIT array
consisting of two subsarrys $\cal X$ and $\cal Y$ of the same size
$M$. They are identical and separated by a fixed distance $d$.
Each pair of identical elements of these two subarrays may be
called {\em doublet}. The directional gain and phase response of
these doublets may be completely different. The relationship
between the carrier signals received by each doublet is expressed
as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\matrix{\bS^x(t)&=&\bS^y(t)\bD_S}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bS^x(t)$ and $\bS^y(t)$, respectively, denote
the signal matrix $\bS(t)$ received by subarray $\cal X$ and $\cal
Y$ at time $t$ and

\begin{equation}
\bD_S=diag\{\matrix{e^{j2\pi f_1d\sin\theta_1/c}&\ldots&e^{j2\pi
f_Kd\sin\theta_K/c}}\}
 \label{D_S}
\end{equation}

\noindent denotes the spatial rotation diagonal matrix.

With the definitions in (\ref{MatrixModel}), the time-domain
correlation matrices of the outputs of subarray $\cal X$ and $\cal
Y$ can be constructed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\bR_T^{xx}=\frac{1}{M}E\{\bX^{H}(t)\bX(t)\}
=\bA_T\bP_s\bA_T^H+\sigma^2\bI\  \\ \\
\bR_T^{yx}=\frac{1}{M}E\{\bY^{H}(t)\bX(t)\}
=\bA_T\bP_s\bD_S\bA_T^H
\end{array} \label{CorrelationXY}   \label{CorrelationXX}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bX$ and $\bY$ denote the signal matrix $\bcR$
received by subarray $\cal X$ and $\cal Y$, respectively.


\subsection{Least Squares Estimation}

In order to estimate the DOA and FOA simultaneously, we define a
special signal parameter matrix $\bR$ as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\bR&=&\mathbf{\bar{R}}_T^{xx+}\bR_T^{yx}&=&(\bR_T^{xx}-\sigma^2\bI)^+\bR_T^{yx}
\end{array}\label{RLS}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{\bar{R}}_T^{xx}=\bR_T^{xx}-\sigma^2\bI$
is the correlation matrix of subarray $\cal X$ or $\cal Y$ without
noise.

Furthermore, when the ranks of matrices $\mathbf{A}_T$ and
$\mathbf{P}_s$ are $K$, the $k$th column of the temporal steering
matrix is the eigenvector of the signal parameter matrix, which
corresponds to the $k$th diagonal element of the diagonal matrix
$\mathbf{D}_S$. This can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rll}
\bR\bA_T&=&\mathbf{A}_T\mathbf{D}_S\hspace{0.1in}.
\end{array}\label{LS}
\end{equation}

Finally, the frequency and direction of each signal source can be
estimated from one pair of an eigenvector and a nonzero
eigenvalue. As a result, they are automatically coupled.
Furthermore, we can see that, in (\ref{RLS}), the size of the
square matrix $\bR$ is $M$, which can be set to an arbitrary
number regardless of the physical array size. This means that even
with a single doublet, it is still possible to estimate as many
incoming signals as desired, provided that there are enough array
measurements available.

\subsection{Total Least Squares Estimation}

Using (\ref{RLS}) and (\ref{LS}), the direction and frequency of
each incoming signal source can be jointly estimated without any
additional search or pairing procedure. No knowledge of the
subarray responses is required, either. In fact, the signal
parameter matrix $\bR$ defined in (\ref{RLS}) is the least squares
solution to the following optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bR_{\rm LS
}&=&\min\limits_{\bZ}\left\|\hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}-\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}\bZ\right\|_2
\end{array}
\label{LS1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}$ and $\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$
denote the estimate of ${\bR}_{T}^{yx}$ and $\bar{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$,
respectively.

Here, it is assumed that $\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$ is equal to
$\bar{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$. This is not always true, though they may be
very close. Given noisy measurements, both the estimated matrix
$\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$ and $\hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}$ contain errors.
Hence, the LS estimate will inherently be biased~\cite{Huff91}. It
seems reasonable to treat the uncertainties in the matrices
symmetrically. In order to utilize both information from
$\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$ and $\hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}$, the following
optimization problem is presented to estimate the signal parameter
matrix $\bR$:


\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bR_{\rm TLS}&=&\min\limits_{\bZ}\left\| \left[ \matrix{
\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}\cr \hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}}
\right]-\left[\matrix{\bar{\bR}_{T}^{xx}\cr\bar{\bR}_{T}^{xx}\bZ}\right]\right\|_2
\end{array}\ .\label{TLS}
\end{equation}

\noindent Solving the minimization problem in (\ref{TLS}) results
in a total least squares estimate of the $\bR$~\cite{Huff91},
which maps the columns of $\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}$ onto those of
$\hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}$. The TLS estimate of the signal parameter
matrix, $\bR_{\rm TLS}$, can be presented as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bR_{\rm
TLS}&=&(\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xxT}\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xx}-\sigma_{K+1}^2\bI)^{+}\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xxT}\hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\sigma_{K+1}$ is the $(K+1)$st largest eigenvalue
of $[\tilde{\bR}_{T}^{xxT}\ \hat{\bR}_{T}^{yx}]$.

\subsection{Space-Time Processing Improvement}

It is clear that it is very important to obtain accurate estimates
of the correlation matrices in the subspace algorithms. The
correlation matrices defined in (\ref{CorrelationXX}) can be
directly estimated with time-domain averaging. This can be
expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\mathbf{R}}_T^{xx}&=&\frac{1}{MN}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}\bX(t-nT_s)\bX^{H}(t-nT_s)\\
\\
\hat{\mathbf{R}}_T^{yx}&=&\frac{1}{MN}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}\bX(t-nT_s)\bY^{H}(t-nT_s).
\end{array}\label{estimatedRXX}\label{estimatedRYX}
\end{equation}

\noindent Obviously, the estimates in (\ref{estimatedRXX}) only
utilize the property of the received signal that it is stationary
in the time-domain, though the received signal $r_m(t)$ is also
assumed to be stationary in the space-domain. Hence, when $r_i(t)$
is stationary both in space and time, the matrices
$\mathbf{R}_T^{xx}$ and $\mathbf{R}_T^{yx}$ are Toeplitz matrices
and can be estimated by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\mathbf{R}_T^{xx}=\mathbf{R}_T^{xxH}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
r_0^{xx} & r_1^{xx\ast} & \cdots & r_{L-1}^{xx\ast}\\ r_1^{xx} &
r_0^{xx} & \cdots & r_{L-2}^{xx\ast}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots &
\vdots\\ r_{L-1}^{xx} & r_{L-2}^{xx} & \cdots & r_0^{xx}
\end{array}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{r}
r_p^{xx}=\frac{1}{2M(L-p)}\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L-p}\mbox{E}\{r_m^x(t-lT_s)r_m^{x\ast}(t-(l+p)T_s)\\
+r_m^y(t-lT_s)r_m^{y\ast}(t-(l+p)T_s)\}

\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent $p=0$, $1$, $\ldots$, $L-1$, and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathbf{R}_T^{yx}&=&\left[\begin{array}{cccc} r_0^{yx} &
r_{-1}^{yx} & \cdots & r_{-L+1}^{yx}\\ r_1^{yx} & r_0^{yx} &
\cdots & r_{-L+2}^{yx}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
r_{L-1}^{yx} & r_{L-2}^{yx} & \cdots & r_0^{yx}
\end{array}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
r_q^{yx}=\frac{1}{M(L-q)}\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L-q}\mbox{E}\{r_m^{y\ast}(t-(l+q)T_s)r_m^x(t-lT_s)\}\\
\\
r_{-q}^{yx}=\frac{1}{M(L-q)}\sum\limits_{m=1}^{M}\sum\limits_{l=1}^{L-q}\mbox{E}\{r_m^{y\ast}(t-lT_s)r_m^x(t-(l+q)T_s)\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent $q=0$, $1$, $\ldots$, $L-1$.

The above space-time joint averaging on the collected data should
improve the estimate of the correlation matrices which should be
much closer to the theoretical values. Thus, it is expected that
the performance of the proposed joint DOA/FOA estimation algorithm
is improved as well.

\section{Performance Analysis}

\subsection{Analysis of Estimation Errors}

It is not easy to give a close-form expression for the proposed
DOA/FOA estimation schemes which extend the classic ESPRIT
algorithm since the directions and frequencies are directly
associated with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix
$\bR$. But we know that in both the LS and TLS estimates of the
matrix $\bR$, the following expression holds regarding the errors
in the matrices $\bar{\bR}_T^{xx}$, $\bR_T^{yx}$ and
$\bR$~\cite{Rao89}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\Delta\bR&\approx&\bar{\bR}_T^{xx+}\left(\Delta\bR_T^{yx}-\Delta\bar{\bR}_T^{xx}\bR\right)\hspace{0.1in}.
\end{array}\label{DeltaR}
\end{equation}

\noindent When $\|\Delta\bR\|$ is very small, we can give the
following first-order approximation of the errors in $f_i$,
$\theta_i$, $i=1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $K$.


\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\Delta f_i\approx
-j{3f_s\over\pi(L-1)L(2L-1)}\ba_i^H\bW(\bR-\lambda_i\bI)^{+}(\Delta\lambda_i\bI-\Delta\bR)\ba_i
\end{array}\label{approx_theta}
\end{equation}


\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\Delta\theta_i \approx -j{c\over 2\pi
f_id\cos\theta_i}\bv_i^H\bar{\bR}_T^{xx+}\left(\Delta\bR_T^{yx}-\lambda_i\Delta\bar{\bR}_T^{xx}\right)\bu_i\\
\hspace{0.3in}+j{3f_s\tan\theta_i\over\pi(L-1)L(2L-1)f_i}\ba_i^H\bW(\bR-\lambda_i\bI)^{+}(\Delta\lambda_i\bI-\Delta\bR)\ba_i,
\end{array}\label{approx_f}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\lambda_i$, $\bv_i$ and $\bu_i$ denote the $i$th
eigenvalue, and the left- and right-eigenvector of $\bR$,
respectively, $\ba_i$ denotes the steering vector $\ba_T(f_i)$,
$\bW=\mbox{diag}\left\{0,\ 1,\ \ldots,\ (L-1)\right\}$, $j$
denotes the imaginary unit and $\Delta\cdot$ denotes the error in
a scalar, vector or matrix.

\subsection{Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound}

The CRLB is given by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). To compute the FIM, we first define the parameter vector
$\mathbf{\phi} = \left[\sigma^{2}, \bs_{R}^{T}, \bs_{I}^{T},
\btheta^{T}, \bbf^{T} \right]^{T}$, where $\bs_{R}(t) = {\Re}
\left\{ \bs(t) \right\}$, $\bs_{I}(t) = {\Im}\left\{ \bs(t)
\right\}$, $\btheta = \left[ \theta_{1}, \ldots,
\theta_{K}\right]^{T}$, and $\bbf = \left[ f_{1}, \ldots, f_{K}
\right]^{T}$.   Then, the FIM is defined to be

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
{\rm FIM}&=&{\rm CRLB}^{-1} & =& {\rm E} \left\{ \left(
\frac{\partial \ln L}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right) \left(
\frac{\partial \ln L}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right)^{H} \right\}
\label{fim}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where, with the data model in (\ref{VectorModelT}) and
(\ref{MatrixModel}), $\ln L$ is the log-likelihood function given
by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ln
L&=&C-LMK\ln\sigma^2-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{L-1}\parallel\mathbf{e}(t-lT_s)\parallel_2^2
\end{array}\label{logl}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $C$ being a constant and
$\mathbf{e}(t-lT_s)=\mathbf{r}(t-lT_s)-\mathbf{A}_S\bD_T^{l}\bs(t)$.

It can be shown that the CRLB for the parameters of interest
($\btheta$ and $\bbf$) are

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathbf{CRLB}(\mathbf{\theta})&=&{\mathbf{\cal
P}}^{-1}+{\mathbf{\cal P}}^{-1}{\mathbf{\cal O}}^T[{\mathbf{\cal
Q}}-{\mathbf{\cal O}}{\mathbf{\cal P}}^{-1}{\mathbf{\cal
O}}^T]^{-1}{\mathbf{\cal O}}{\mathbf{\cal P}}^{-1}\\
\mathbf{CRLB}(\mathbf{f})&=&[{\mathbf{\cal Q}}-{\mathbf{\cal
O}}{\mathbf{\cal P}}^{-1}{\mathbf{\cal O}}^T]^{-1}
\end{array}\label{CRLBf}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\mathbf{\cal
O}}&=&\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\mathbf{f},\mathbf{\theta}}-\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\Re\{\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{f}}^H(t)\mathbf{\Phi
B}_{\mathbf{\theta}}(t)\}\\ {\mathbf{\cal
P}}&=&\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\mathbf{\theta}}-\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\Re\{\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{\theta}}^H(t)\mathbf{\Phi
B}_{\mathbf{\theta}}(t)\}\\
 {\mathbf{\cal
Q}}&=&\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\mathbf{f}}-\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\Re\{\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{f}}^H(t)\mathbf{\Phi
B}_{\mathbf{f}}(t)\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}


\noindent and the $\bLambda$'s, $\bB$'s and $\mathbf{\Phi}$ are
defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\mathbf{f}}&=&\displaystyle{2\over\sigma^2}\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{L-1}\Re\{\mathbf{S}^H(t)\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{f}}^{lH}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{f}}^{l}\mathbf{S}(t)\}\\
\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\mathbf{\theta}}&=&\displaystyle{2\over\sigma^2}\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{L-1}\Re\{\mathbf{S}^H(t)\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{lH}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{l}\mathbf{S}(t)\}\\
\mathbf{\Lambda}_{\mathbf{f},
\mathbf{\theta}}&=&\displaystyle{2\over\sigma^2}\sum\limits_{t=1}^{N}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{L-1}\Re\{\mathbf{S}^H(t)\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{f}}^{lH}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{\theta}}^{l}\mathbf{S}(t)\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\matrix{\mathbf{\Phi}&=&\displaystyle{2\over\sigma^2}\sum\limits_{l=0}^{L-1}\bD_T^{lH}\bA_S^H\bA_S\bD_T^{l}}
\end{array}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}

\section{Computer Simulations}

In this section, computer simulations were carried out to support
the performance of the proposed algorithms. In the following
simulations, the emitter signals were generated as constant
amplitude planewaves with random phase, uniformly distributed on
[$0$, $2\pi$].  There are four incoming signals,
$(+30^{\circ},5.5{\rm MHz})$, $(0.0^{\circ},3.5{\rm MHz})$,
$(-60^{\circ},7.5{\rm MHz})$ and $(+75^{\circ},1.5{\rm MHz})$,
simultaneously arriving at the array.The MSE of the estimates are
compared with the CRLB and the approximation analysis in
(\ref{approx_theta}) and (\ref{approx_f}).

\subsection*{Case 1: Performance versus SNR}

\begin{figure}

\caption{MSE of DOA estimates versus SNR using one doublet,
$N$=500, $L$=5, $K$=4.} \label{SF_DOASNR}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{SF_FOASNR.eps}
\caption{MSE of FOA estimates versus SNR using one doublet,
$N$=500, $L$=5, $K$=4.} \label{SF_FOASNR}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We assume there are $M=2$ antenna elements in the array receiver,
while there are $K=4$ incoming signals. $L=5$ and $N=500$. The MSE
of the DOA/FOA estimation of the signal source ($+30^{\circ}$,
$5.5MHz$) are calculated and shown in Figs. \ref{SF_DOASNR} and
\ref{SF_FOASNR}, respectively. The MSE of the estimates are
steadily decreasing with the increase of SNR. The performance of
improved algorithms are better than LS-TDE in FOA estimation.

\subsection*{Case 2: Performance versus L}


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{SF_DOAL.eps}
\caption{MSE of DOA estimates versus $L$, $N$=500, $M$=2, $K$=4,
$SNR$=10dB.} \label{SFDOAL}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{SF_FOAL.eps}
\caption{MSE of FOA estimates versus $L$, $N$=500, $M$=2, $K$=4,
$SNR$=10dB.} \label{SFFOAL}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figs. \ref{SFDOAL} and \ref{SFFOAL}, we examine the performance
of all the proposed ESPRIT algorithms with the increase of $L$.
The performance of DOA/FOA estimation becomes better. One reason
is that, with the increase of $L$, the estimation of FOA becomes
better due to more accurate subspace separation.

\subsection*{Case 3: Performance versus M}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{SF_DOAM.eps}
\caption{MSE of DOA estimates versus $M$, $N$=500, $L$=5, $K$=4,
$SNR$=10dB.} \label{SFDOAM}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{SF_FOAM.eps}
\caption{MSE of FOA estimates versus $M$, $N$=500, $L$=5, $K$=4,
$SNR$=10dB.} \label{SFFOAM}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In Figs. \ref{SFDOAM} and \ref{SFFOAM}, we examine the performance
of all the proposed ESPRIT algorithms with the increase of $M$.
There is no obvious change of the performance with the increase of
$M$. One reason is that the increase of $M$ is equivelant to
increase the sampling number $K$ in Eq. \ref{CorrelationXX}.
Usually, increasing $M$ cannot significantly improve the
estimation of DOA/FOA.

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we consider a ESPRIT array and extend the classic
ESPRIT algorithm for DOA/FOA estimation. All the proposed
algorithms are simple and direct. There are additional pairing
procedure and the number of the sources being simultaneously
estimated can be arbitrarily larger than the number of the antenna
elements to be used. In practice, this is expected to be helpful
to reduce the hardware investment.
